{Part 4}
9. go to commit tab -> it is present under project tab(upper left tab, present vertically under project tab) ->
    you will find changes and unversioned files
10. files under changes or files with green txt color are in staging area and (not committed yet or not in repo currently)
11. files under unversioned files -> present in red txt color -> they are not even in repo or neither in staging area
12. select the files that you want to commit by selecting checkboxes before file names
13. write a message in blank space that contains message "Commit Message".
14. you can go to project -> now files are not in green -> but if you do some change in files they will come back to
    blue color i.e. staging area
    (it means changes are yet to be committed)

    perform revert in background

    files
